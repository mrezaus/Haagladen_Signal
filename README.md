# Haagladen_Signal
Signal Processing Assets for Haagladen Medisch Hospital Dataset.<br>
This Project is about sleep analysis and staging sleep using heart signals.

The results will be published as a scientific paper. (The paper is ready for submission)<br>
The model can predict the correct sleep stage on the test set with an accuracy of **68%**. <br>
After publishing, the final codes will be shipped.<br>
Here's a pair plot of the main extracted features after normalization. (The image size is about 10MB after compression to demonstrate the details.)<br>
